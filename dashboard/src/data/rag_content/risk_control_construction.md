# Risk Control Recommendations by Construction Type

## ISO Construction Class 1 - Frame Construction

### Description
Buildings with exterior walls, floors, and roofs made of wood or other combustible materials. This includes wood frame, log construction, and buildings with combustible siding over wood studs.

### Key Risk Factors
- Highly susceptible to fire spread
- Vulnerable to wind damage in hurricane/tornado zones
- Wood deterioration from moisture and termites
- Higher total loss potential

### Standard Recommendations

**Fire Protection**
- Install automatic sprinkler system (NFPA 13 compliant)
- Maintain minimum 30-foot defensible space in wildfire zones
- Install Class A fire-rated roofing materials
- Add fire-resistant barriers between units in multi-family structures
- Ensure electrical systems are updated and inspected annually

**Wind Mitigation**
- Install hurricane straps/clips connecting roof to walls
- Upgrade to impact-resistant windows in coastal areas
- Secure roof sheathing with 8d ring-shank nails at 6" spacing
- Add secondary water barrier under roofing

**Maintenance Requirements**
- Annual termite inspection
- Moisture barrier inspection every 2 years
- Electrical system inspection every 3 years
- Roof inspection annually, especially after major storms

## ISO Construction Class 2 - Joisted Masonry

### Description
Buildings with masonry exterior walls (brick, concrete block, stone) but with combustible floors and roof. The masonry provides fire resistance for walls only.

### Key Risk Factors
- Roof and floor assemblies remain combustible
- Masonry walls can collapse if floor/roof supports burn
- Moisture penetration through mortar joints
- Settling cracks can compromise structural integrity

### Standard Recommendations

**Fire Protection**
- Install automatic sprinkler system throughout
- Add fire stopping at all floor-wall connections
- Install smoke detection in all concealed spaces
- Maintain 2-hour fire separation between tenant spaces

**Structural Integrity**
- Inspect mortar joints every 5 years, repoint as needed
- Monitor for settlement cracks, repair promptly
- Ensure proper flashing at roof-wall connections
- Install weep holes for moisture drainage

**Roof Protection**
- Upgrade to non-combustible roof deck where feasible
- Install Class A roofing assembly
- Add roof-mounted smoke/heat vents in large open areas

---

## ISO Construction Class 3 - Non-Combustible

### Description
Buildings with exterior walls, floors, and roofs of metal, gypsum, or other non-combustible materials. However, these materials may not have fire-resistance ratings.

### Key Risk Factors
- Steel loses strength at high temperatures (above 1000°F)
- Metal panel roofs vulnerable to wind uplift
- Condensation issues in metal buildings
- Contents fire can still cause structural damage

### Standard Recommendations

**Fire Protection**
- Apply fire-resistive coating to structural steel
- Install automatic sprinkler system
- Provide adequate fire department access
- Install draft curtains in large open areas

**Wind Protection**
- Verify roof panel attachment meets FM Global 1-90 or higher
- Install continuous ridge caps
- Secure wall panels at maximum 12" spacing in high-wind zones
- Add internal bracing for lateral load resistance

**Maintenance**
- Inspect roof fasteners annually for corrosion
- Check panel seams for sealant integrity
- Monitor for condensation damage
- Touch up protective coatings on exposed steel

## ISO Construction Class 4 - Masonry Non-Combustible

### Description
Buildings with masonry exterior walls and non-combustible floors and roof (steel, concrete). Provides good fire resistance but steel still vulnerable to heat.

### Key Risk Factors
- Similar steel vulnerability as Class 3
- Masonry walls require ongoing maintenance
- Older buildings may have unprotected steel
- Parapet walls vulnerable to seismic damage

### Standard Recommendations

**Fire Protection**
- Verify fireproofing on all structural steel members
- Install sprinkler system per NFPA 13
- Add fire barriers at tenant demising walls
- Ensure adequate egress capacity

**Seismic Protection**
- Brace or remove unreinforced parapets
- Install flexible connections at expansion joints
- Anchor non-structural elements (HVAC, shelving)
- Retrofit unreinforced masonry walls if required by code

**Envelope Maintenance**
- Inspect masonry annually for deterioration
- Maintain waterproof coatings on exterior
- Ensure positive drainage away from foundation
- Seal all penetrations

## ISO Construction Class 5 - Modified Fire Resistive

### Description
Buildings with exterior walls, floors, and roofs of masonry or fire-resistive materials with ratings between 1-2 hours. Common in mid-rise construction.

### Key Risk Factors
- Fire ratings may be compromised by penetrations
- Age-related degradation of fireproofing
- HVAC and electrical penetrations create pathways
- Renovation may have damaged fire barriers

### Standard Recommendations

**Fire Protection Integrity**
- Inspect all fire-rated assemblies annually
- Seal penetrations with listed firestopping materials
- Verify fireproofing thickness on steel members
- Test fire doors and dampers per NFPA 80

**Life Safety**
- Verify adequate exit capacity
- Test emergency lighting quarterly
- Ensure fire alarm system is monitored
- Conduct annual fire drills

**Documentation**
- Maintain records of all fire barrier penetrations
- Document fireproofing repairs
- Keep fire protection system inspection reports
- Track fire door inspection/maintenance

---

## ISO Construction Class 6 - Fire Resistive

### Description
Buildings with exterior walls, floors, and roofs of reinforced concrete or protected steel with fire-resistance ratings of 2 hours or more. Typical high-rise construction.

### Key Risk Factors
- High-rise evacuation challenges
- Stack effect can spread smoke rapidly
- Fire department access limitations above 75 feet
- Complex mechanical/electrical systems

### Standard Recommendations

**High-Rise Specific**
- Maintain all stairwell pressurization systems
- Test smoke control systems semi-annually
- Ensure fire pump capacity meets demand
- Verify standpipe system operational

**Fireproofing Maintenance**
- Inspect spray-applied fireproofing annually
- Document and repair any damaged areas
- Verify minimum thickness requirements
- Check fireproofing above suspended ceilings

**Emergency Preparedness**
- Develop comprehensive emergency action plan
- Train floor wardens on all occupied floors
- Coordinate with local fire department annually
- Maintain current building plans at fire command center

**Systems Maintenance**
- Test generator under load quarterly
- Inspect fire pumps weekly, flow test annually
- Verify elevator recall operation monthly
- Test emergency communication systems quarterly
