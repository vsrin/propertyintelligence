# COPE Analysis Reference Guide

## Overview

COPE is the fundamental framework for evaluating commercial property risk:
- **C**onstruction - Building materials and structural characteristics
- **O**ccupancy - How the building is used and by whom
- **P**rotection - Public and private fire protection features
- **E**xposure - External factors that could cause or spread loss

Each element is evaluated independently, but their interactions determine overall risk quality.

## Construction (C)

### ISO Construction Classes

**Class 1 - Frame**
- Exterior walls: Wood or other combustible material
- Floors/roof: Combustible
- Risk level: Highest fire severity
- Common examples: Small retail, older residential conversions, strip malls
- Fire spread: Very rapid, often total loss
- Typical rate relativity: 1.00 (base)

**Class 2 - Joisted Masonry**
- Exterior walls: Masonry (brick, block, stone)
- Floors/roof: Combustible wood joists
- Risk level: High fire severity
- Common examples: Main street retail, older mixed-use
- Fire spread: Walls survive but interior often total
- Typical rate relativity: 0.85

**Class 3 - Non-Combustible**
- Exterior walls: Metal, gypsum, or other non-combustible
- Floors/roof: Non-combustible (unprotected steel)
- Risk level: Moderate fire severity
- Common examples: Warehouses, big box retail, industrial
- Fire spread: Contents fire can damage steel structure
- Typical rate relativity: 0.70

**Class 4 - Masonry Non-Combustible**
- Exterior walls: Masonry
- Floors/roof: Non-combustible
- Risk level: Moderate fire severity
- Common examples: Older commercial, schools
- Fire spread: Contained but steel vulnerable to heat
- Typical rate relativity: 0.60

**Class 5 - Modified Fire Resistive**
- Exterior walls: Masonry or fire-resistive rated
- Floors/roof: 1-2 hour fire rating
- Risk level: Lower fire severity
- Common examples: Mid-rise office, newer construction

## Protection (P)

### Public Protection Classification (PPC)

**Class 1-3** - Superior protection

- Adequate water supply (1,000+ GPM)
- ISO rating reflects capability
- Rate impact: Most favorable

**Class 4-6** - Good protection
- Paid or combination departments
- Reasonable response times (under 8 minutes)
- Good water supply
- Rate impact: Standard

**Class 7-8** - Limited protection
- Volunteer departments
- Extended response times
- Possible water supply limitations
- Rate impact: Significant loading

**Class 9** - Minimal protection
- Volunteer with limitations
- Very long response times
- Water supply issues
- Rate impact: Heavy loading

**Class 10** - No recognized protection
- No fire department response
- No water supply
- Rate impact: May be uninsurable

### Private Fire Protection

**Automatic Sprinkler Systems**
- Wet pipe: Most common, immediate response
- Dry pipe: Used in freeze-prone areas
- Pre-action: High-value areas, prevents water damage
- Deluge: High-hazard areas, immediate total discharge
- ESFR (Early Suppression Fast Response): High-ceiling storage

**Sprinkler System Requirements**
- Minimum NFPA 13 compliant
- Annual inspection per NFPA 25
- 5-year internal inspection
- Adequate water supply
- Proper maintenance records

**Fire Detection/Alarm**
- Smoke detection (ionization, photoelectric)
- Heat detection (rate-of-rise, fixed temperature)
- Manual pull stations
- Monitoring (central station, proprietary)
- Integration with suppression

**Special Suppression Systems**

- Paint booth suppression
- Transformer deluge systems
- Dust collection system protection

### Protection Red Flags
- Impaired or out-of-service sprinklers

## Exposure (E)

### External Exposure Types

**Building Exposure**
- Adjacent buildings within 100 feet
- Construction type of adjacent buildings
- Occupancy of adjacent buildings
- Fire separation (walls, distance)
- Shared walls or common attic space

**Weather Exposure**
- Hurricane/windstorm zones
- Earthquake fault proximity
- Flood zone classification
- Wildfire interface
- Tornado/hail frequency
- Lightning exposure

**Crime Exposure**
- Neighborhood crime rates
- Vandalism history
- Burglary/theft potential
- Civil unrest considerations
- Terrorism target potential

**Environmental Exposure**
- Contamination from neighbors

- Pipeline proximity
- Power line exposure

### Exposure Distance Guidelines

**Severe Exposure** (0-10 feet separation)
- Frame buildings: Direct fire spread likely
- Non-combustible: Radiant heat damage possible
- Action: Fire wall required or rate for both

**Moderate Exposure** (11-30 feet separation)
- Frame buildings: Significant fire spread risk
- Non-combustible: Some radiant heat exposure
- Action: Evaluate wall openings, construction

**Light Exposure** (31-100 feet separation)
- Frame buildings: Flying brand exposure
- Non-combustible: Limited direct exposure
- Action: Note but limited rate impact

**Negligible Exposure** (100+ feet separation)
- Generally not a factor
- Exception: Large fire potential (refineries, lumber yards)
- Action: Standard rating

### Exposure Red Flags
- Frame building within 30 feet
- High-hazard neighbor (chemical storage, lumber yard)
- Shared walls without fire rating
- Vacant/abandoned adjacent buildings
- Brush/vegetation encroachment

### Exposure Green Flags
- Adequate fire separation

## COPE Interactions

### High-Risk Combinations

**Construction + Occupancy**
- Frame restaurant: Extreme fire potential
- Non-combustible woodworking: Steel vulnerable to contents fire
- Joisted masonry with heavy storage: Floor collapse potential

**Occupancy + Protection**
- High-hazard without sprinklers: Unacceptable
- Restaurant without hood suppression: Major deficiency
- Warehouse without adequate sprinkler density: Inadequate protection

**Construction + Exposure**
- Frame building with frame neighbor: Conflagration potential
- Non-combustible with chemical neighbor: Contamination risk
- Any construction in flood zone without elevation: Total loss potential

### Favorable Combinations

**Construction + Protection**
- Fire resistive + sprinklers: Excellent fire performance
- Non-combustible + monitored alarm: Good protection
- Any construction + proper protection for occupancy: Risk improved

**Occupancy + Location**
- Office in low-crime area: Reduced theft exposure
- Warehouse away from flood zones: Eliminated flood risk
- Retail in managed shopping center: Shared protection benefits
