- Sprinkler protection (reduces severity 50-70%)
- Building age (older = more damage potential)
- Ceiling height (high-rack storage increases severity)

**Contents Factors**
- Commodity type (plastics, flammables increase severity)
- Storage configuration (high-pile increases severity)
- Business interruption exposure (supply chain criticality)
- Seasonal inventory peaks

**Response Factors**
- Fire department response time
