## Building Age Considerations

### Pre-1940 Buildings
- Comprehensive inspection required
- Electrical upgrade documentation mandatory
- Plumbing assessment recommended
- Consider limited coverage on older systems
- Historical preservation requirements may apply

### 1940-1970 Buildings
- Verify code updates at renovation
- Assess original systems condition
- Review any asbestos/lead documentation
- Consider equipment breakdown coverage

### 1970-1990 Buildings
- Standard underwriting with maintenance verification
- Check for polybutylene plumbing (1978-1995)
- Verify seismic compliance (CA post-1975)
- Review roof history and condition

### 1990-2010 Buildings
- Generally acceptable condition
- Verify maintenance program
- Check roof age approaching end of life
- Review any prior claims

### Post-2010 Buildings
- Most favorable underwriting terms
- Built to modern codes
- Typically well-documented
- Standard inspection requirements

## Loss History Guidelines

### Favorable (Target)
