### Recommendations by Risk Level

**High Risk (7-10)**

- **9-10 (Severe)**: Direct wildland exposure, historical fire path

### Recommendations by Risk Level

**High Risk (7-10)**
- Create defensible space: Zone 1 (0-30 feet) - lean, clean, green
- Zone 2 (30-100 feet) - reduce fuel continuity, limb trees up 6-10 feet
