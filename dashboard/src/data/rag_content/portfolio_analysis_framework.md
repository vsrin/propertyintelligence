## Portfolio Concentration Analysis

### Geographic Concentration Thresholds

**Hurricane Exposure**
- Acceptable: <15% of TIV in Tier 1 coastal
- Watch: 15-25% in Tier 1 coastal
- Concern: >25% in Tier 1 coastal
- Action: Reduce concentration or increase reinsurance

**Earthquake Exposure**
- Acceptable: <20% of TIV in high seismic zones
- Watch: 20-30% in high seismic zones
- Concern: >30% in high seismic zones
- Action: Seismic assessment requirements, capacity limits

**Flood Exposure**
- Acceptable: <10% of TIV in Zone A/AE
- Watch: 10-20% in Zone A/AE
- Concern: >20% in Zone A/AE
- Action: Require NFIP, elevation verification

### Single Risk Concentration
- Maximum single location: 5% of total portfolio TIV
- Maximum single insured: 10% of total portfolio TIV
- Maximum single county (CAT zone): Per reinsurance treaty
